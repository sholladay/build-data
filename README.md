> Get metadata for your build.

## Why?

 - Useful for managing [build processes](https://github.com/sholladay/build-dir).
 - Reliable and concurrent data collection.
 - Intelligent behavior in or out of a repository.

## Install

```sh
npm install build-data --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const buildData = require('build-data');
```

Get the current [branch name](https://github.com/sholladay/branch-name) and [build version](https://github.com/sholladay/build-version) to be associated with your build.

```js
buildData().then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```

Get the data that was used for the most recent build.

```js
buildData.latest().then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```

You can and should provide any data you know already.

```js
buildData({ version : '3.2.1' }).then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```
