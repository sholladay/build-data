# build-data [![Build status for build-data](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/build-data/master.svg "Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/build-data "Builds")

> Get metadata for your build

## Why?

 - Useful for managing [build processes](https://github.com/sholladay/build-dir).
 - Reliable and concurrent data collection.
 - Intelligent behavior in or out of a repository.

## Install

```sh
npm install build-data --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const buildData = require('build-data');
```

Get the current [branch name](https://github.com/sholladay/branch-name) and a [version](https://github.com/sholladay/build-version) to be associated with your build.

```js
buildData().then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
    // {
    //     branch  : 'master',
    //     version : '1.0.0'
    // }
});
```

Get the data that was used for the most recent build.

```js
buildData.latest().then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```

You can and should provide any data you know already.

```js
buildData({ version : '3.2.1' }).then((data) => {
    console.log('data:', data);
});
```

## API

Returns a `Promise` for an `object` with the git `branch` and a newly generated `version`, based on the status of the `cwd`.

### buildData.latest(option)

Same as `buildData()`, except `branch` defaults to the most recently built branch and `version` defaults to the most recently built version of the `branch`.

#### option

Type: `object`

##### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.cwd()`

Parent directory of the build root.

##### branch

Type: `string`
